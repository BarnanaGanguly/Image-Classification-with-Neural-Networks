# Image-Classification-with-Neural-Networks

**Satellite Image Classification using Neural Networks**

Dive deep into satellite image classification with our neural network model, designed and executed using PyTorch. This repository systematically classifies various landforms and usage types, as sourced from the EuroSAT_RGB data.

**Key Highlights**:
- **Dataset Breakdown**: This data set offers JPG images, each representing one of the 11 unique categories. The specific class of each image is denoted by the subdirectory it belongs to.

- **Neural Network Structure**: Harnessing the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), renowned for their efficiency in image recognition tasks, we've built a robust classifier.

- **Model Evaluation**: Within the repository, you'll find:
  - A precise measurement of our model's overall test-set accuracy.
  - A visual showcase featuring a selection of test set images alongside the model's predictions.
  - An in-depth confusion matrix that offers a meticulous comparison between the test set images' actual and predicted classes.

Venture into this repository to understand the nuances of satellite imagery and the incredible capabilities of neural network analysis.
